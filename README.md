## **Systems, Scripts & Under-the-Hood Engineering Log**

A living archive of my deep-tech explorations — from low-level **C internals** to **Lua scripting quirks**, from classic **CLI craftsmanship** to the secret mechanics that make real systems tick.

This repo captures the parts of engineering most programmers avoid:  
the **internals**, the **whys**, and the **architecture beneath the abstractions**.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here

### **1. C-Level Thinking 🧩**

- Memory models, pointers & stack/heap behavior
- Compiler mechanics & build pipelines
- Experiments that reveal _how machines actually behave_

### **2. Lua Craftsmanship 🐉**

- Lightweight scripting patterns
- Embedded logic & micro-automation
- Clean, expressive idioms that make Lua magical

### **3. Classic CLI Sorcery ⚙️**

- Shell pipelines, automation rituals & terminal workflows
- Debugging through logs, traces, and raw system signals
- Productivity hacks only terminal nerds understand

### **4. Systems Reasoning 🧠**

- Architecture deep dives
- Runtime & OS-level behavior
- Understanding the _why_, not just the _what_

### **5. Experiments & Micro-Prototypes 🧪**

- Breaking assumptions on purpose
- Rebuilding broken pieces to learn their design
- Tracing weird behaviors to their root cause

### **6. Hacker-Style Debugging 🛠️**

- “Fixing” is secondary — the priority is **understanding**
- Reverse-engineering misbehaviors to map unseen internals
- Logbook entries of debugging sessions gone wild

## ⚡ Philosophy

This is not a tutorial repo.  
This is my **technical journal**, **nerd chronicle**, and **hacker workspace**.

A place where:

- Exploration > convenience
- Understanding > abstraction
- Curiosity > shortcuts
